## 🚀 Overview

Spec-as-Code is an innovative solution that bridges the gap between specifications and code implementation. Our AI agent automatically analyzes pull requests, compares them against project specifications, and creates suggested updates to keep documentation perfectly synchronized with your codebase.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Automatic Sync**: AI-powered analysis keeps specs and code aligned
- **📋 ADO Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Azure DevOps workflows  
- **🤖 AI Agent**: Intelligent analysis of code changes vs specifications
- **📝 Smart Updates**: Automated spec update proposals via pull requests
- **⚡ Zero Friction**: Works with your existing development process

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Create Work Item** - PM creates an ADO Work Item for new features
2. **Check in Spec** - PM adds specification (Markdown) to the repository
3. **Engineer Commits PR** - Developer implements feature and creates pull request
4. **AI Agent Analysis** - Our AI scans the PR and compares against the spec
5. **Propose Updates** - Agent creates draft PR with suggested spec changes
6. **Review & Sync** - PM reviews and approves updates, keeping everything aligned
